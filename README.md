# GAITEway-2018

GAITEway stands for Girls' Artificial Intelligence and Technology Education, where we want to lead the way for young girls to learn more about the scientific world. GAITEway is an official 501(c)(3) nonprofit outreach program. Our primary goal is to help middle school girls in low-income or underrepresented communities understand the true potential of the AI and CS fields and how they can affect the worldâ€™s vision of technology. We want to provide a supportive group of peers and mentors in order to make the participants feel comfortable in the learning environment. With GAITEway, we hope to boost the confidence in middle school girls so they can see what they are truly capable of. Also, inspiring young girls to pursue AI and CS in the future through GAITEway is one of our first steps to slowly close the gender gap in STEM which are primarily male-dominated.
